# CS207 Autonomous race car project 1.0
===================================

This project is an arduino uno based autonomus race car. The goal of this project is to convert a existing RC car to a autonomus car that no longer needs user input to drive. The car will used ultra sonic sensors
to detect and avoid objects in its path.
